# What is SyncGuard?

SyncGuard is a TypeScript distributed lock library that prevents race conditions across microservices. It provides a simple API for coordinating access to shared resources using Redis, PostgreSQL, or Firestore as the backend.

## The Problem: Race Conditions in Distributed Systems

When multiple services or processes work on the same resource, race conditions happen:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Without locks: payment processed twice
async function processPayment(paymentId: string) {
  const payment = await getPayment(paymentId);

  if (payment.status === "pending") {
    await chargeCard(payment.amount); // Process 1 charges
    await updateStatus(paymentId, "completed"); // Process 2 also charges!
  }
}
```

Two instances read `status: 'pending'` simultaneously. Both charge the card. Oops.

::: danger Why Database Transactions Aren't Enough
Database transactions don't help when the work involves external APIs (payment processors, emails, webhooks) or spans multiple databases.
:::

## The Solution: Distributed Locks

SyncGuard ensures only one process executes the critical section:

```typescript
import { createLock } from "syncguard/firestore";

const lock = createLock(db);

// ‚úÖ With locks: only one process wins
await lock(
  async () => {
    const payment = await getPayment(paymentId);
    if (payment.status === "pending") {
      await chargeCard(payment.amount);
      await updateStatus(paymentId, "completed");
    }
  },
  { key: `payment:${paymentId}`, ttlMs: 60000 },
);
```

The first process acquires the lock. Others wait or retry. Your customer gets charged once.

## Key Features

- üî¢ **Fencing tokens** ‚Äî Monotonic counters prevent stale lock holders from corrupting data (see [Fencing Tokens](/fencing))
- üßπ **Automatic cleanup** ‚Äî TTL-based expiration means locks release even if your process crashes
- üîê **Ownership tracking** ‚Äî Each lock gets a unique ID; only the owner can release or extend it
- üîÑ **Backend flexibility** ‚Äî Use Redis for speed, PostgreSQL for relational database infrastructure, or Firestore for serverless‚Äîsame API, same guarantees
- üîÅ **Smart retries** ‚Äî Exponential backoff with jitter handles contention automatically
- üíô **TypeScript-first** ‚Äî Compile-time type safety with capability inference

## When to Use SyncGuard

### ‚úÖ Perfect For

**Preventing duplicate processing**

```typescript
// Ensure job runs exactly once across workers
await lock(() => processJob(jobId), { key: `job:${jobId}` });
```

**Idempotency enforcement**

```typescript
// Webhook received multiple times? Handle once
await lock(() => handleWebhook(eventId), { key: `webhook:${eventId}` });
```

**Rate limiting**

```typescript
// One request per user per minute
const result = await backend.acquire({
  key: `rate:${userId}`,
  ttlMs: 60000,
});
if (!result.ok) throw new Error("Rate limit exceeded");
```

**Scheduled tasks**

```typescript
// Daily report generated by any instance, but only once
await lock(() => generateDailyReport(), {
  key: "cron:daily-report",
  ttlMs: 300000,
});
```

**Resource coordination**

```typescript
// Prevent concurrent deploys
await lock(() => deployToProduction(), { key: "deploy:prod" });
```

## When NOT to Use SyncGuard

### ‚ùå Anti-Patterns

::: warning High-Frequency Operations
Don't use locks for every API request or database query. Network round-trip per lock acquisition adds latency (~1-50ms). Consider optimistic concurrency or database locks instead.
:::

**Short critical sections**

- If your critical section is faster than acquiring the lock, you're doing it wrong
- Example: incrementing a Redis counter (use `INCR` instead)

**Within database transactions**

- Database transactions already provide isolation
- Locks are for coordinating work _outside_ a single database

**As a queue replacement**

- Locks coordinate access, they don't distribute work
- Use Redis Streams, SQS, Pub/Sub, etc. for job queues

**Long-running workflows without extension**

- Locks expire via TTL (default: 30s)
- For long tasks, use `backend.extend()` periodically or break into smaller steps

## How It Works

1. **Acquire**: Request lock with unique key (e.g., `payment:123`)
2. **Execute**: Run your critical section while holding the lock
3. **Release**: Free the lock for others (or let TTL expire automatically)

::: info Atomic Operations Guarantee
SyncGuard uses atomic operations (Lua scripts for Redis, transactions for PostgreSQL and Firestore) to ensure:

- No race window between checking and acquiring
- Ownership verified before release/extend (see ADR-003)
- Monotonic fence tokens for stale lock protection
